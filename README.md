## 🚀 Focus & Goals

- 🧱 **Mastering fundamentals**  
  Deepening knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL through structured learning and a lot of hands-on practice.  
  In the next step, I plan to add modern frontend and/or backend frameworks to my stack once my core foundations feel solid.

- 🎨 **Frontend & UI**  
  Creating responsive, accessible layouts and interactive components with clean and maintainable code.

- 🔧 **Backend Development**  
  Building data-driven applications with PHP and MySQL – working with CRUD operations, queries, authentication, and real-world features.

- 🛠️ **Workflows & Tools**  
  Using Git/GitHub, Windows as main development environment and Linux on a secondary machine, plus Docker and modern IDEs to establish professional workflows and improve productivity.

- 📂 **Project-Oriented Learning**  
  Focusing on small to mid-sized projects (e.g. digital handover protocols, shift planning tools) to connect theory with practice and build a solid portfolio over time.

## 📚 Learning Path

[![freeCodeCamp](https://img.shields.io/badge/freeCodeCamp-Full_Stack_Path-0a0a23?style=flat&logo=freecodecamp&logoColor=white)](https://www.freecodecamp.org)  
[![JavaScript.info](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript.info-Core_JavaScript-f7df1e?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)](https://javascript.info/)  
[![W3Schools](https://img.shields.io/badge/W3Schools-Reference_%26_Examples-04aa6d?style=flat&logo=w3schools&logoColor=white)](https://www.w3schools.com/)  

> 🧠 Learning by doing – courses and docs are important, but real understanding comes from building things.  
> 📦 My main focus is on practical projects that I can iterate on, improve and eventually use in real scenarios.

## 💡 Currently Practicing

- Writing clean, semantic and accessible HTML and CSS  
- Building responsive layouts & UI components with **JavaScript (frontend focus)**  
- PHP + MySQL: basic CRUD, queries and simple authentication flows  
- Working through the freeCodeCamp full stack path and selected JavaScript resources  
- Using W3Schools and official documentation as a quick reference while coding  
- Getting more comfortable with Git and Docker in real projects  
- Using Linux occasionally on a secondary machine to slowly build up CLI and system knowledge

---

## 🧰 Tools for Freelancers & Real Projects

- Planning and building web apps that solve concrete, real-world problems (e.g. digital handover protocol, shift planning, internal tools)  
- Focusing on code quality, clear structure and maintainability to make projects ready for long-term use  
- Using GitHub to document progress, ideas and iterations so that each project can grow from MVP to a more professional version over time

---

## 🌐 Linux, DevOps & Cybersecurity (on the side)

- Using Linux occasionally on a laptop to get familiar with the environment and common CLI workflows  
- Exploring basic DevOps concepts (containers with Docker, simple deployment workflows, automation) alongside web development  
- Gradually getting into cybersecurity fundamentals to better understand secure coding, authentication, permissions and infrastructure basics  
- Treating these topics as a long-term side track that supports my main goal: becoming a solid, reliable full-stack web developer

## ✨ Philosophy

> 🧩 *Consistency creates clarity.*  
> 🌱 *Every project is a step towards mastery.*  
> 🔍 *Progress matters more than perfection.*

## 🔭 What’s next

- Starting my first real-world style web apps (e.g. digital handover protocol or small tools for everyday problems)  
- Gradually moving from simple static pages to full-stack applications with authentication, databases and deployment  
- Evaluating and learning modern frameworks (e.g. a JavaScript frontend framework and a PHP or Node.js backend framework) once my fundamentals are strong enough
