## 🛠️ Skills & Technical Foundations
I follow a **"Fundamentals First"** approach – understanding *why* something works is more important than using the next shiny tool.  

### 🧩 Core Stack (Fundamental Basics)
*Technologies from my early practical phases and foundational modules:*

## 🚀 Growth & Roadmap 2026
Roadmap for my next steps: Python backend + DevSecOps + exam preparation (AP1 → AP2).  

### 🔹 Python & Backend
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)
![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-009688?style=for-the-badge&logo=fastapi&logoColor=white)
![Flask](https://img.shields.io/badge/Flask-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=flask&logoColor=white)
![Django](https://img.shields.io/badge/Django-092E20?style=for-the-badge&logo=django&logoColor=white)
![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-003B57?style=for-the-badge&logo=sqlite&logoColor=white)

- Python as my main language for scripting, automation, backends, microservices, and potentially native or hybrid apps – keeping options open for what the future brings.  
- Learning FastAPI, Flask, and Django for APIs and server‑rendered apps, while staying flexible for other architectures and use cases.  
- Working with PostgreSQL, SQLite, and relational database concepts.  

### 🔹 DevSecOps Fundamentals
![Docker](https://img.shields.io/badge/Docker-2496ED?style=for-the-badge&logo=docker&logoColor=white)
![GitHub%20Actions](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub_Actions-2088FF?style=for-the-badge&logo=githubactions&logoColor=white)
![DevSecOps](https://img.shields.io/badge/DevSecOps-0A0A23?style=for-the-badge&logo=security&logoColor=white)

- Understanding basic CI/CD pipelines (e.g. GitHub Actions) and automated checks.  
- First steps with Docker for reproducible environments and local experimentation.  
- Focusing on “Security by Design”: dependency checks, secrets handling, least privilege, and simple policies.  

### 🔹 Exam & Project Perspective (AP1 → AP2)
- **AP1 preparation (February 2026):**  
  - Networks, IT security basics, hardware, databases, and project management.  
  - Using Python and scripts to support learning where it makes sense.  
- Looking ahead to **AP2 (final project):**  
  - Aim: a real‑world project centered around Python with a strong focus on architecture and security.

## 📚 Education, Milestones & Structure
| Area | Focus | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AP1 (FIAE)** | Networks, security, databases, project management | 🎯 Feb 2026 – in preparation |
| **Python Backend** | Language, OOP, APIs, DB access | 🏗️ Being built |
| **DevSecOps Basics** | CI/CD, basic security checks, Docker | 🚀 2026 roadmap |
| **Frontend Basics** | Semantic HTML, CSS, basic JS | ✅ Foundation in place |

## 🧪 Practical Exercises & Learning Projects

### 🚀 [AP1 Tracker – Exam Prep Companion](https://github.com/cwillam/ap1-tracker)
> **Live Demo:** [ap1.cwillam.de](https://ap1.cwillam.de)

A modern, offline‑first web app to track learning progress for the German IT Specialist exam (AP1).  

- **Concept:** Structured topic overview with progress tracking using LocalStorage.  
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS – deliberately without heavy frameworks to strengthen fundamentals.  
- **Approach:** Clear logic, iterative refactoring, and AI‑assisted pair programming.  

> **Next step:** Integrate per‑topic learning scripts (small focused pages or tools for each subtopic) directly into the tracker.
