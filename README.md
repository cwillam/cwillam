## 💼 Professional Development & AP2 Perspective
I am currently in the first phase of my training and focused on a successful AP1 exam.

* **Open Mindset:** While I am passionate about my personal roadmap (TS/React), I am **open to any professional environment** that offers solid mentorship and quality standards. I am not limited to a specific stack for my future practical phases.
* **AP2 Outlook:** I am looking for a supportive partner for my **Final Project (AP2)** in 2026. My main goal is to grow as a developer and contribute to real-world solutions, regardless of the underlying technology.
* **What I bring:** A strong work ethic, a curiosity for complex systems, and the ability to bridge the gap between different technologies.
