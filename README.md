# 👋 Hi, I'm Christoph

**Aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer**  
Currently building my full-stack development skills through focused practice and hands-on learning. I’m working to understand how everything connects – from the frontend to backend – while developing a solid foundation in real-world web development.

## 🚀 Focus & Goals

- 🧱 **Mastering the fundamentals**  
  Strengthening my core knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP and SQL through structured learning and repetition.

- 🖥️ **Frontend & UI Practice**  
  Creating responsive layouts and interactive UIs using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript – focusing on code structure, accessibility and usability.

- 🔧 **Exploring Backend Technologies**  
  Gradually learning server-side development with PHP and Node.js – understanding databases, routing, and data flow at a fundamental level.

- 🧰 **Tooling & Workflows**  
  Getting comfortable with Git, GitHub, Linux CLI, debugging, and clean code – integrating them into daily practice.

- 🎯 **Project Preparation**  
  Practicing smaller challenges and exercises to prepare for upcoming full projects, real-world apps, and portfolio building.
